# data engineering 
Author CHU Quang Nguyen Hoang
## Introduction:
- This document is intended for referencing to Data Engineering and related concepts about databases.<br> which is written based on what I've learned in Udacity's Data Engineering course. The link to the course is attached at the bottom of this material.<br>
This course contains 4 main parts and each part was separated into small lessons, after some lessons you will have exercises and demos to revise what you've learned.
- You'll need to have knowledge about:
  - Intermediate Python Skills
  - Intermediate SQL skills (but if you don't, don't worry, we will learn everything from scratch)
## Main Part:
- For reading the material, please go to **"Document.MD"** <br>
(This material was written in MARKDOWN style, it's supported reading by GITHUB, but if you want to download it, make sure you have support applications or plugin that can read the ".md" file)
- Best recommend application is **"VISUAL STUDIO CODE"** with an extension called **"MARKDOWN PREVIEW ENHANCE"** by **Yiyi Wang** (because I am writing by this extension :D )<br><br>
**NOTE**: Depending on what extension you use in Visual Studio Code, this "DOCUMENT.MD" structure will be different or damaged, so my best recommendation is to go straight to the "MARKDOWN PREVIEW ENHANCE" extension.

I HOPE YOU WILL ENJOY WHAT I'M DOING. <peace out>
## Note:
1. I'm always encouraging to **get the course** at all costs, it will bring you the best experience ( + **YOUR OWN CERTIFICATION** by Udacity), but if you don't have time, please feel free to use mine as a reference.
2. As I said above, this material is all about what I've learned and what I thought it was (personally) important to write it down, so basically, there might be missing some information that was mentioned in the main Udacity's Data Engineering Course.<br>
