# data engineering
## Introduction:
This document is intended for reference in Data Engineering and related concepts about database.<br>
Materials is written based on what I've learnt in Udacity's Data Engineering course. The link of the course is attached at the bottom of this material.<br>
This course contains 4 main parts and each part was seperated into small lessons, after some lessons you will have excercises and demos to revise what you've learnt.
## Main Part:
For reading the material, please go to "DOCUMENT.MD" 
(This material was written in MARKDOWN style, it's supported reading by GITHUB, but if you want to download it, make sure you have support applications or plugin can read ".md" file)
- Best recommend application is "VISUAL STUDIO CODE" with extension called "MARKDOWN PREVIEW ENHANCE" by Yiyi Wang (because I am writting by this extension :D )<br><br>
**NOTE**: Depends on extension in Visual Studio Code, the structure of this "DOCUMENT.MD" will be damaged, so my best recomend is go straight to "MARKDOWN PREVIEW ENHANCE" extension.
